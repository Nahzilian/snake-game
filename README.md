# Snake game 
A simple snake game using LinkedList inspired by Clement Mihailescu https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Rkib_fvowE

To start: npm start

## Idea

- Store all the cell of the snake inside the linkedlist
- Have a different set to store the index of the cells


## Backlog

- Adjust the movement of the snake
    - Snake should not be able to go the other direction
- Resolve the tail growing problem
